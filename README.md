# Magento 2 Theme Frontend Rapid

Free, fully responsive Magento 2 theme created for the Fashion industry - but not only.
This theme is an extension of the default theme for Magento 2 "theme-frontend-blank".
It was written to streamline the development process by adjusting the most frequently modified parts of the site to this industry.

## Compatibility
* This module was written based on Magento 2.1.9 

## Extensibility
This module possesses specially prepared “less” files - “_extend-specific.less”, which allow the module to be extended.
If the theme “theme-frontend-rapid” is used, the inheritance of themes is as follows:

An example of the less file structure for a particular project based on "Divante / specific" using the theme “frontend-rapid” is as follows:

app/design/frontend/Divante/specific - Package/Theme  
app/design/frontend/Divante/specific/Magento_Theme - Specific module as an example  
app/design/frontend/Divante/specific/Magento_Theme/web/css/source/_extend-specific.less - File to extend
